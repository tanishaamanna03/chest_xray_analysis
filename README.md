<h1> Chest X-Ray Analysis System </h1>

A deep learning-based system for analyzing chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia. This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset.

## Features

- AI-powered chest X-ray analysis
- Real-time image display
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Quality assessment of X-ray images
- Detailed recommendations based on analysis
- Support for multiple image analysis in one session

## Dataset Source

The project uses the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle:
[Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Run the script

2. The system will:
   - Train the AI model
   - Show you the range of available images
   - Allow you to select an image for analysis
   - Display the X-ray image
   - Provide analysis results and recommendations

3. Enter the number of the image you want to analyze (or 0 to exit)

## Important Notes

- This is an AI-assisted diagnostic tool and should not replace professional medical advice
- Always consult with healthcare professionals for medical decisions
- The system's predictions are based on machine learning and may not be 100% accurate
- The confidence score indicates the model's certainty in its prediction
